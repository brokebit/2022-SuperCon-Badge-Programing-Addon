# 2022 SuperCon Badge USB Programing Add On Module
This add on is an open source hardware add on that allows you to easily upload/download programs via USB and interact with the Input & Output pins via buttons and LEDS. It also passes all header pins through so you can daisy chain other add ons. Input buttons, output LEDs and the USB Uart can all be disabled via DIP switches. 
## Features
- Passthrough header
- Four input buttons for input I/O pins
- Four output LEDs for output I/O pins
- CP210x USB Uart for serial I/O and upload/download programs
